# Trained Model - Placement Prediction

This repository contains the trained machine learning model for placement prediction. The model has been developed using various algorithms and trained on a dataset specifically curated for predicting placement outcomes.

## Model-Selection

The trained model utilizes a combination of algorithms and techniques to predict the likelihood of a student being placed in a company. The model takes into account various features such as academic performance, skills, internships, and other relevant factors.


## Usage

To use the trained model for placement prediction, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.
2. Load the trained model from the provided pickle file.
3. Prepare the input data for prediction, ensuring it matches the required format.
4. Pass the input data to the model for prediction. 
5. Retrieve the predicted placement outcome from the model's output. 

```python
# Example code for using the trained model

# Import necessary libraries and dependencies
import pickle
# Load the trained model from the pickle file
model = pickle.load(open('trained_model.sav', 'rb'))

# Prepare input data for prediction
input_data = ...

# Make predictions using the model
predictions = model.predict(input_data)

# Retrieve the predicted placement outcome
placement_result = ...

# Do further processing with the placement result
```

*Please note that you need to replace 'trained_model.pkl' with the actual path or filename of the trained model file.*
