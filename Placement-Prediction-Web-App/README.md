# Placement-Prediction-Web-App


Welcome to the repository for our minor project on the Placement Prediction Model!
This repository contains all the necessary resources, including data, notebooks, and documentation, for our project.


## INTRODUCTION

In today's competitive world, every student aims to secure a placement in a reputed organization to begin their career.One of the major challenges that educational institutes face today is to improve their placement performance and ensure that their students are successful in securing job placements.
However, predicting whether a student will be placed or not is a challenging task for educational institutions.

To address this issue, the Placement Prediction Model is developed using Machine Learning techniques.
The Placement Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system designed to enhance the campus placement performance of educational institutions. By analyzing historical data and considering factors such as academic performance and student skills, the model predicts the probability of students getting placed in reputed organizations. This model enables students to focus on improving their skills and provides valuable insights to educational institutions, helping them identify and support students who need additional guidance. The project aims to contribute to the overall improvement of the placement management process and empower students for successful career prospects in technical fields.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem is the uncertainty faced by students and educational institutions regarding placement outcomes. Students need accurate insights into their employability to improve their skills and increase their chances of securing placements. Educational institutions require a reliable system to identify students who need additional support and guidance to enhance their employability. The goal is to develop a Placement Prediction Model that utilizes historical data to predict the probability of current students getting placed. This model aims to provide valuable insights to students and institutions, improving placement outcomes and optimizing resources for targeted support.

```


## USAGE

The project notebooks in the notebooks directory provide step-by-step guidance on using the Placement Prediction Model. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Explore the data: Begin by examining the datasets in the data directory. Understand the structure and contents of the data, including the historical placement records and relevant parameters.

2. Preprocess the data: Use the preprocessing notebook to clean, transform, and engineer features from the data. Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and ensure the data is ready for model training.

3. Train the model: Utilize the training notebook to apply the Logistic Regression Algorithm on the preprocessed data. Train the model using appropriate techniques and evaluate its performance.

4. Evaluate the model: Use the evaluation notebook to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the trained model. Analyze key metrics and performance indicators to gain insights into its predictive capabilities.

5. Predict placements: Apply the trained model on new student data to predict the probability of placement for the current year. Follow the prediction notebook for guidance on making accurate predictions.


## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

We have identified several potential areas for future enhancements of the Placement Prediction Model:

-Incorporate additional parameters: Explore the inclusion of more parameters, such as extracurricular activities, internships, and project work, to improve the accuracy and predictive power of the model.

-Experiment with different algorithms: Investigate the performance of alternative classification algorithms, such as Random Forests or Support Vector Machines, to compare and potentially enhance the prediction capabilities of the model.

-Develop a user-friendly interface: Build a user interface that simplifies the usage of the Placement Prediction Model, allowing users to input data easily and obtain predictions quickly.

-Include recommendations and suggestions


## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The Placement Prediction Model has shown promising success in predicting the likelihood of students getting placed. Through extensive testing and evaluation, the model has demonstrated a high level of accuracy in its predictions, providing valuable insights for students and educational institutions.

During the evaluation process, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 76% on training data and 73% on testing data, indicating its ability to correctly predict the placement status of students. This high accuracy rate is a testament to the effectiveness of the logistic regression algorithm employed in the model.

The model's success can be attributed to its consideration of various factors such as academic performance, technical skills, internships, and other parameters. By analyzing these parameters and their correlations, the model is able to generate accurate predictions of a student's probability of getting placed in campus recruitment drives.
